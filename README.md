# Tic-tac-toe-game
This project is a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in the C programming language, designed for two players to compete against each other in a console environment. It leverages core programming concepts such as loops for managing game flow, 2D arrays to represent the game board, and structures to efficiently track player data like wins and symbols. The game features a dynamic board display that updates after every move, robust win-condition checking for rows, columns, and diagonals, and intelligent draw detection. As a standout feature, it also incorporates file handling to automatically save match results—including wins, losses, and draws—to an external text file, ensuring data persistence between sessions. Developed to strengthen understanding of fundamental C programming, this project showcases practical application of control structures, data management, and input/output operations in a structured and interactive format.
