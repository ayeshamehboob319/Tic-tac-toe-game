# Tic-tac-toe-game
Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C is a complete console-based implementation where two players begin by entering their names for a personalized experience. The game board is clearly displayed as a 3x3 grid, and players take turns choosing positions numbered 1–9 to place their 'X' or 'O'. After each move, the board updates and the program checks for a winner across rows, columns, or diagonals—or declares a draw if the board fills up. The game smoothly handles invalid moves and automatically saves each match result—including player names and outcomes—to a file named game_results.txt. Designed with a structured and modular approach, it utilizes functions like initializeBoard(), boardDisplay(), makeMove(), checkingWinner(), and saveResult() to ensure clean code and a seamless user experience. Ideal for learning core C programming concepts such as arrays, structures, file handling, and loops, this project offers both an entertaining game and a practical demonstration of fundamental coding techniques.
